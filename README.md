# Exchange_Reports_SpecialOPs
The SpecialOps project on making One-pagers for Exchange students for the University they are interested in.

Things to clear up: 
1. How to get the reports (where are they stored? Local copies?)
2. Which libraries for extracting the text? (PYtesseract with OCR?) Which libraries for Text Analysis? (For sentiment analysis)
3. How to create the onepager - create a class with attributes and turn this into a PDF?
4. Create a template? Is this possible/allowed?
5.
